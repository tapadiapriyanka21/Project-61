    <p>I was a Dancer since i was in my mother's womb my family said. They said I would dance in my mother's womb. I have participated in Ganesh Chaturti, my school's cultural programmes and my family members marriage. I am active all day and I keep dancing every time. I got many steps while dancing and was always really fun. I love creating my own steps. I don't like many old songs but like some of them like Yeh Ladka Hai Deewana, Yeh Ladka Hai Allah etc.<br><br><span class="story">And this is the end of my story</span><br><br><span class="story">My Story By,</span><br><br><span class="story">Priyanka Tapadia</span> </p>
